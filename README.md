🔢 Sorting Visualizer

A simple and interactive Sorting Visualizer built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project helps learners understand how different sorting algorithms work through clear, step-by-step animations.

🔗 Live Demo:
https://student-nirajkumar.github.io/Sorting-Visualizer/

🎯 Features

Visualizes the process of sorting an array in real time

Color-based animations for comparisons and swaps

Adjustable array size and sorting speed controls

Clean, modern, and fully responsive user interface

Includes sound effects for better interactive learning (if enabled)

🧠 Algorithms Included

This visualizer currently supports the following sorting algorithms:

Bubble Sort

Selection Sort

Insertion Sort

Quick Sort

Merge Sort

More algorithms can be added in future updates.

🛠 Technologies Used
Technology	Purpose
HTML	Base structure of the visualizer
CSS	Styling, layout, and responsive design
JavaScript	Sorting logic, animations, and UI interactions

│ style.css           # Styling and UI theme
│ script.js           # Sorting logic and visualization

🚀 How It Works

1️⃣ Generates a random array of bars
2️⃣ User selects a sorting algorithm
3️⃣ Visualization shows comparisons, swaps, and final sorted order
4️⃣ Colors help track the sorting steps:

🔵 Comparing elements

🟥 Swapping elements

🟩 Correct position (sorted)

📌 Future Improvements

Potential enhancements planned for upcoming versions:

Display swap count and comparison count

Show time complexity of each algorithm

Side-by-side algorithm performance comparison

Ability to export sorting steps as JSON for study/reference

Dark/Light theme toggle option
